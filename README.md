#  Cooking Activity Detection using ML & IoT

## Project Overview
This project aims to detect cooking activities using IoT sensor data and machine learning. It focuses on classifying cooking and non-cooking events based on environmental sensor readings and building a scalable ML pipeline that can be extended to real-time deployment.

## Work Done So Far
- Data collection and organization from IoT sensors  
- Data cleaning and preprocessing using Jupyter Notebook  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Feature selection and feature engineering  
- Handling class imbalance  
- Model training using Random Forest Classifier  
- Hyperparameter tuning with RandomizedSearchCV  
- Model evaluation using confusion matrix, precision, recall, and F1-score
